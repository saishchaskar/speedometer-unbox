The errors indicate that some required dependencies are missing from your project. Here’s how you can resolve them:

Steps to Fix
	1.	Install Missing Dependencies:
Run the following commands to install the required packages:

npm install chartjs-adapter-date-fns
npm install web-vitals


	2.	Verify Installation:
After installation, check if the packages are correctly added to your package.json file under dependencies.

"dependencies": {
  "chartjs-adapter-date-fns": "^2.0.0",  // Ensure this version or later is present
  "web-vitals": "^3.0.0"                // Ensure this version or later is present
}


	3.	Clear Cache and Rebuild:
If the issue persists, clear the npm cache and rebuild the project:

npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run start


	4.	Check Import Statements:
Ensure you are importing the packages correctly in your code:
	•	For chartjs-adapter-date-fns:

import 'chartjs-adapter-date-fns';


	•	For web-vitals (in reportWebVitals.js):

import { getCLS, getFID, getLCP } from 'web-vitals';


	5.	Delete and Reinstall node_modules:
If the above steps don’t work, delete the node_modules folder and reinstall all dependencies:

rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run start

Additional Tips
	•	Ensure your Node.js and npm versions are up to date.

node -v
npm -v


	•	If you continue to face issues, try deleting the package-lock.json file and reinstalling dependencies:

rm package-lock.json
npm install
